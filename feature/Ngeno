# Assignment Documentation: SkillSyncProjectAlpha

This assignment involved cloning a Git repository and navigating directories. I created a new feature branch, modified the README.md file, and documented the procedure using proper commands.

## Steps Taken

1. **Clone the Project Repository**
   - I navigated to the target project directory using the `cd` command. In that directory, I cloned the repository to my local machine using the appropriate command.
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/rcacfs/SkillSyncProjectAlpha.git
     ```

2. **Verify Project Directory**
   - I listed all folders using `ls`to ensure that I had cloned the above repository:
     ```sh
     ls
     ```
   - I navigated into the project directory with:
     ```sh
     cd SkillSyncProjectAlpha
     ```
   - Then, Open to edit README.md file using nano:
     ```sh
     nano README.md
     ```

3. **Open Project in Visual Studio Code**
   - I decided to continue with Visual Studio Code, launching it using:
     ```sh
     code .
     ```

4. **Create a New Branch**
   - I created a new branch named `feature/Ngeno` using:
     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature/Ngeno
     ```

5. **Modify README.md File**
   - I added the statement "This is skillsync branch. And this is a branching strategy" to the shared `README.md` file.
   - After saving the changes, I executed the following commands to stage, commit, and push the changes respectively:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial Commit"
     git push -u origin feature/Ngeno

     ```

6. **Create Ngeno.md File**
   -  I created a new Markdown file in Vscode using:
     ```sh
     touch Ngeno.md
     ```

7. **Document Procedure with Screenshots**
   - I documented the entire procedure and included relevant screenshots.

8. **Finally modified this file to add the 2 final steps - This and the following**
   - I documented the entire procedure and included relevant screenshots.
